### Problem Statement: Nearest Greater to Left (NGTL)

Given an array of integers, for each element in the array, find the nearest element to the left which is greater than the current element. If no such element exists, output `-1` for that element.

#### Input:
- An array of integers `arr[]` of size `n`.

#### Output:
- An array of integers `result[]` of the same size as `arr[]`, where each element in `result[i]` represents the nearest greater element to the left of `arr[i]` or `-1` if no such element exists.

#### Example:

**Input:**
```plaintext
arr[] = [4, 5, 2, 10, 8]
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
result[] = [-1, -1, 5, -1, 10]
```

**Explanation:**
- For 4, no element is to the left, so `-1`.
- For 5, no element is to the left greater than 5, so `-1`.
- For 2, the nearest greater element to the left is 5.
- For 10, no element is to the left greater than 10, so `-1`.
- For 8, the nearest greater element to the left is 10.

### Why Need to Do This Problem?

The "Nearest Greater to Left" problem is an important stack-based problem because it helps you understand how to use stacks to efficiently solve problems involving comparisons between elements of an array. The concept of finding the nearest greater element can be applied to a variety of real-world situations, such as:

1. **Stock Price Prediction**: If you're analyzing stock prices, the nearest greater to left problem can help identify when a price was higher than the previous prices and how far back that happened. It helps in predicting potential future price trends.

2. **Building Stock Charts**: In visualizing data, you might need to find out when a particular stock price was higher than others to mark significant points on a chart.

3. **Algorithm Optimization**: This problem is a precursor to many other problems in algorithm design, such as "Nearest Smaller to Left," and helps in mastering efficient algorithms for handling similar data structures.

### Practical Daily Aspects Solved by This Problem

1. **Efficient Search in Real-Time Data**: In many practical applications, such as data analysis and real-time systems, you may need to process a list of numbers where you have to identify previous higher values quickly. This problem teaches how to use stacks to get results in O(n) time, which is more efficient than brute-force searching for each element.

2. **Computer Graphics and Visualization**: This problem can be used in graphics where you need to determine the "height" or "depth" comparison of certain elements in a set or visualization, like histograms or bar charts.

3. **Network Traffic Analysis**: In scenarios where data packets need to be analyzed for peak flow or traffic, the nearest greater to left problem can help track where the highest value (e.g., packet size or bandwidth usage) occurred in real-time history.

4. **Queue Management Systems**: In systems where resources are distributed based on capacity or priority, finding the nearest "greater" value is crucial for optimizing performance and distributing resources efficiently.

### Importance in the Context of Stack Problems

The "Nearest Greater to Left" problem is fundamental because it forms the base for many other stack-based problems. Solving this problem helps in mastering the use of stacks, which are vital in numerous algorithmic problems involving comparisons, sequences, and intervals. Some of the important problems derived from NGTL include:

1. **Nearest Greater to Right (NGTR)**: A similar problem but looking for the nearest greater element to the right. Understanding NGTL builds the foundation for this and related problems.

2. **Stock Span Problem**: This is a real-world application where you need to find the span of stock prices. The solution is closely related to the nearest greater to left problem.

3. **Histogram Maximum Area**: In problems involving rectangles in a histogram, the knowledge of nearest greater to left helps in optimizing the area calculation.

4. **Next Greater Element Problem**: Often used in algorithms like "next greater element to the right" or finding the next larger value for every element.

Understanding NGTL is essential as it builds a foundational skill in handling dynamic and comparative problems efficiently using stacks, which is a core concept in data structures and algorithms.

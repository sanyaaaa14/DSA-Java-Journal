/*
Explanation:

Brute Force Approach:
- We check each element and compare it to all the previous elements.
- For every element, we iterate through all previous elements to find the nearest greater element.
- This results in a time complexity of O(nÂ²) because for each element, we are checking all previous elements.

Optimized Approach with Stack:
- We use a stack to store elements in such a way that for each new element, we can efficiently find the nearest greater element to its left.
- For every element, we compare it with the top element of the stack.
- If the stack contains elements smaller than the current element, we pop them out.
- The stack helps in finding the nearest greater element in O(1) time once it's processed.
- This ensures that each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once, leading to a time complexity of O(n).

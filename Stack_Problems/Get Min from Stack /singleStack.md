üß± Min Stack ‚Äî Single Stack with Encoded Minimums (Range-Bounded)

üß† Intuition  
The aim is to design a stack that supports `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `getMin` in constant time ‚Äî **using only a single stack**.  
Instead of maintaining a separate stack for the minimums, we **encode both the element and the minimum at that stage** into a single integer using the formula:  
encoded_value = element * RANGE + current_min.
This reduces space usage but only works within a **bounded range** of values.

‚öôÔ∏è Approach  

- Maintain a single stack `st` that stores encoded values.
- On `push(x)`:
  - If the stack is empty, push `x * RANGE + x` (as x is also the min).
  - Otherwise, push `x * RANGE + min(x, current_min)`.
- On `pop()`:
  - Simply pop from the stack.
- On `peek()`:
  - Return `stack.peek() / RANGE` to get the top element.
- On `getMin()`:
  - Return `stack.peek() % RANGE` to get the current minimum.

üìõ ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Limitation**  
This technique works **only if input values stay within a safe integer range**.  
- In this code, `RANGE = 101`.  
- That means values should be less than 101 to avoid **collision between `element * RANGE + min`**.
- If `x >= 101`, it may **corrupt** the decoding of `peek()` and `getMin()`.

‚è±Ô∏è Complexity  

Time Complexity:  
- `push`, `pop`, `peek`, `getMin` ‚Äî all O(1)

Space Complexity: O(n)  
- Uses only one stack for storing both values and state.

üß© Key Concepts Used

- Mathematical encoding of state (value + min)
- Constant-time min tracking with optimized space
- Integer operations for data compression

üìå Use Case

This approach is helpful when:
- Memory optimization is critical
- Input values are within a known small range
- You want to avoid managing two separate stacks

But not suitable for:
- Arbitrary or large-value inputs (risk of overflow or incorrect decoding)

# DSA-Java-Journal
✨ A daily Java-based DSA problem-solving journal with real-world insights, brute-force &amp; optimized approaches, short logic tricks, and interview-ready notes — curated by a final-year B.Tech CSE-AI student.


# 🚀 Daily DSA Journal — Java Edition

Welcome to my **Daily DSA Challenge Repository**, where I post **one Data Structures & Algorithms problem every day** with full explanations, practical use cases, and memory-friendly logic.

## 📌 Why This Repo?

From **23rd April 2025**, I'm on a mission to:

- 🔁 Solve one DSA problem daily
- ✍️ Break down the **problem statement** in simple language
- 🌍 Explain **why this problem is useful in real-world scenarios**
- 🧠 Capture the **brute-force logic** + its time complexity
- ⚡ Write the **optimized Java solution**
- 🧩 Share **memory tricks and analogies** to remember logic forever
- 🧑‍💻 Optionally add a **C++ version** for learners using C++

> This isn't just a DSA repository — it's a personal knowledge vault for revision, interviews, and mastery.

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each day has its own folder, formatted like this:

**DayXX_ProblemName/**  
- `problem.md` — Problem statement and real-world significance  
- `brute_force.md` — Brute-force logic and time complexity  
- `Solution.java` — Java code with comments  
- `optional.cpp` — (Optional) C++ implementation  
- `logic_notes.md` — Short logic with analogies and memory hacks  

🔍 **Example:**  
`Day01_StockSpanProblem/`
